1.phase 1

	1.copy maze project into separate file

	2.create object for player
		1.A position vector
		2.A public maze(MZ)
		3.A char(what to print to the screen)
		4.method for getting coordinates(GetPos) (will return a vector)
		5.method (Move) for moving player will have 2 parameters:
			1.Direction(an consolekey)
			2.HowFar(an int)

			Note: will check with MZ.list.wall's IfCanMove before movement

		6.method (Print)for printing player to the screen

	3.create object for maze walls
		1.A position vector
		2.char(WallChar) for printing to screen
		3.method (IfCanMove) for comparing vectors for movement inside maze (will return a boolean value)
			1.compare for alleged movement to check for conflict within walls
			2.one perameter: a pos vector

		Note: will be stored in a list
	
	4.create object for x and y coordinates (call it a vector)
		1.x pos(int)
		2.y pos(int)
		3.method (GetVectPos) for setting coordinates will have 2 paramaters(pass by referance):
			1.x(int)
			2.y(int)

		4.method (SetVector) for setting coordinates with one parameter:
			1.A vector

		5.CompareVect that returns a boolean value if they are equal with 1 perameter:
			1.Vector to check

	5.create object for maze
		1.list for storing individual wall objects
		2.method for creating objects for all maze wall characters from maze .txt file
		3.method for printing out the entire maze 

	6.create object for mz end
		1.a pos vector
		2.a char for printing
		3.method for if player has won
