exercise: Create a quiz. Ask the user 5 different questions. Each question must have at least 2 possible answers. Use Read() to get the answers. Once they answer all questions, show the user the percentage they got correct.Give them a letter grade (A, B, C ...etc). Then, ask if the user would like to see the correct answers to missed questions. If they answer yes, show them only the questions they missed one by one (with the correct answer). Use ReadKey() to cycle through each wrong answer. If they say no, just end the program.
