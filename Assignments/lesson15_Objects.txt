assignment: 

Create a class called MString. This class will simulate like the string datatype. 

Give it two private attributes:
	CharArray - which will be an array of char's. 
	Size - will keep track of how many characters are in the array

Create three methods (functions of the class):
	SetString - takes an array of char's as a parameter, and stores that array of 		chars into CharArray.
		Note, the method should not point to the orignal array. Change the orignal 		array to test if this works.

	GetString - returns the CharArray. This function should return a copy of whats 		stored. 
		Again, changing one array should not change the other.

	AppendString - will have a char array as a parameter. Add these charaters to the 	end of CharArray. 
		Example, if "Hello" was already stored and I called AppendString(" 			World"). 
		The method should change CharArray to say "Hello World".

Note: For these methods you will need to loop. You can use .length for your loops or you can make a SetString parameter that requires the size of the incoming array. Using 'Size' when looping through CharArray.
