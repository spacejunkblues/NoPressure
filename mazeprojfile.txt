1.phase 1

	1.copy maze project into separate file

	2.create object for player
		1.A position vector
		2.method for getting coordinates (will return a vector)
		3.method (Move) for moving player will have 2 parameters:
			1.vector: current position, where the player is right now
			2.vector: next position of where the player should go next
			
			Note: will check with maze's CheckVectors before movement

	3.create object for maze
		1.A position vector
		2.create method (IfCanMove) for comparing vectors for movement inside maze (will return a boolean value)
			1.will find closest vector
			2.compare for alleged movement to check for conflict
	
	4.create object for x and y coordinates (call it a vector)
		1.method (GetVector) for setting coordinates (will return a vector)
		2.method (SetVector) for getting coordinates (will return a vector) with one parameter:
			1.A vector
