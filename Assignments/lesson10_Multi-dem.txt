exercise: Write a program that allows the user to enter names into a database. You must use Read() and store the names into a jagged char array. First ask the user how many names they would like to store. Once they've entered all names, print the list to the screen. The names can be ANY size. Do not restrict the user to the length of the name they want to enter. Note: Windows uses ascii values will be followed with a 13(carriage return) then a 10(newline). Debugg how Read() works on a mac, and check for both. This should work on windows and a mac (it may be the same)
